 <p>Global Warming is no longer a far off issue.
It is happening right here and right now in our lifetime.</p>
<p>We are the first generation to feel the impact of
climate change and we are the last generation 
that can do something about it.</p>

<h2> How did Global Warming begin?</h2>
              
<p>
    
Global warming has come about due to fossil fuels.
It is found in 96% of the items we use each day. 
One of the major fossil fuels is petrol that we use for cars.</p>
<p>The basic concept of climate change is all these fossil fuels
have accumulated into the atmosphere and resulted 
into earth warming above itâ€™s necessary temperatures.</p>  
    
    
<h2>The effect of Global Warming on islands</h2>
    

<p>If this condition continues then by around 2050 
there will possibly be a 10 to 20 cm sea level rise 
which will make low level pacific islands unlivable 
and in the coming years most of our homes may be 
in danger due to the high risk of sea levels continuing to rise.</p>
<p>If all ice on land melted, the melting fresh water from 
glaciers would increase the sea level by 70 metres 
drowning islands. <p>Now we are seeing the effects around us with the sea level rising,
with people forced to leave their homes and many other negative effects, the list goes on. </p>
