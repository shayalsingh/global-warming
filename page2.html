<h2>How can we help prevent Global Warming?</h2>

<p>We could help by not using cars as much as we do 
    and walking or biking instead.</p>
<p>We could save so much carbon dioxide by just recycling 
half of our household waste.</p>

<h2>Time to make a change</h2>
<p> After all these years we have finally decided to take 
global warming seriously as it is more visible 
    than it has ever been before.</p>

<p>It is easy to talk about change but it is hard to do,
we must change our lifestyle so that the future generations
    can follow in our footsteps.</p>
